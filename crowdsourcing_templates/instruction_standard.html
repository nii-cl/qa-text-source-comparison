      We are collecting questions to study machine understanding of English. Thank you for your help!
    </p>

    <p>
      In this task, you will be given a passage from different sources. Given the passage, <strong>you are asked to write a challenging question with four answer options each.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In writing the questions and answer choices,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You must ensure that there is a single correct answer for a question, and you'll have to mark the correct answer choice.
      </li>
      <li>
        The questions you write must be answerable based on the text in the passage, they should not require specialized knowledge that isn't provided in the passage. For example, if you're given this passage: <i>"As a model, Marilyn Monroe straightened her curly brunette hair and dyed it blonde to make herself more employable,"</i> you can't ask a question about her trademark red lipstick.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should assume that the reader has general background knowledge. For example, a reasonable reader knows that the text is implying that Monroe straightens the hair on her head, not on her arms.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should also assume that the reader can speculate about something that is not explicitly stated in the text. For example, a reader will be able to reason that since Monroe straightens her curly here, it's likely that she was born with curly hair. However, you must ensure that the answer is unambiguous. For a question <i>"What type of hair was Monroe born with?"</i> you could provide these answer choices: <i>curly, straight, blonde, curly blonde</i>. Curly hair is unambiguously the correct answer.
      </li>
      <li>
        It should not be easy to eliminate or guess the answer choice/s without reading the passage. For example, if a question, <i>"Which city was Facebook launched in?"</i> has answer choices (a) <i>Cambridge</i> (b) <i>US</i> (c) <i>China</i> (d) <i>Australia</i>, one can easily eliminate choices (b-d) since they are not cities and arrive at the correct answer (a) without reading the passage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Likewise, it should also not be easy to eliminate answer choice/s <i>without reading the question</i>: If only the correct answer choice from the set of answer choices have relevance (or text overlap) to the information provided in the passage, one can easily guess the right answer choice without even reading the question.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We recommend spending 5-7 minutes on each HIT.

      Guidelines for Writing Hard Questions
    </span>

    <p>
      The goal here is to be creative and write questions that <i>you</i> think are difficult, but that other people like you will still be able to answer if they’re careful. Here are some guidelines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consider questions that ask about:
        <ul>
          <li>Characters' feelings and motivations</li>
          <li>Causes and consequences of described events</li>
          <li>Definition, properties, and process explained in a passage</li>
          <li>Summary and lesson of a passage</li>
          <li><i>Basic</i> arithmetic of numbers in a passage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use words and phrases that don’t appear in the passage
      </li>
      <li>
        Write questions that are answerable based only on the text in the passage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write examples that require a careful reading of the passage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide "distracting" answer choices: options that seem plausible if someone didn’t read the passage carefully
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="context-text">
      <p>
        What is the value to me of those eight minutes? I suppose the conventional answer is to divide my annual earned income by the number of minutes I spend working and so arrive at the income I could gain by having another minute at my disposal. In my case this would be a difficult calculation. The time I spend "working" is not only the time I spend sitting at my word processor and writing these essays. It also includes all the time I spend musing about these essays, while in the shower, or on the bus, or trying to fall asleep, and I have no idea how much time that is in a year. Anyway, the eight minutes I don't spend in the kitchen will probably not be used to earn more income. It will probably be used to lie down listening to music.

      Good Example
    </span>
    <p>
      <u>Question:</u> What did the author think about calculating the value of their eight minutes?
    </p>
    <span><u>Answer options:</u></span>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li>
        (a) It will be challenging since they don't have an exact working time. (<strong>correct</strong>)
      </li>
      <li>
        (b) It should include the time spent when working away from the word processor which they already kept a record of.
      </li>
      <li>
        (c) It is important so that they can earn more income.
      </li>
      <li>
        (d) It could help them find time to listen to music.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i>Explanation: This question is good in part because it rephrases text in the passage. To answer the question, one needs to read the whole passage carefully since no single sentence in the passage answers the question. The answer options also create some difficulty since option (b) seems like a good candidate, however the author stated that they did not measure the working time when they were not sitting at the word processor.</i>
