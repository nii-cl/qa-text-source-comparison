      If it is impossible to say which of the other answer options is most likely to be correct, then select option 5 ("Invalid question / no answer"). An example of this would be if there are 2 answer options that are equally correct. Or if none of the answer choices seem plausible, for example if the answer is 1910 but the options are 1800, 1701, 2005, and 2019.
