      Given the passage, we ask you to write a multiple-choice question with four answer choices. Make sure to write a question where <strong>each answer choice is one or more sentences</strong> (See the instruction for examples). For each question <strong>there is only one right answer</strong> and avoid copying text directly from the passage.<br/>
      <strong><span class="ans-bad">[NEW!]</span></strong> In this batch, <strong>your question has to beat a smart AI, i.e., it cannot answer your questions correctly (but humans can).</strong> Read the full instructions before starting.<br/>
      Note: when you find it too difficult to beat the AI, <strong>you may give up writing a question after three attempts.</strong> If you beat the AI, we will <b>send $1.0 extra bonus per question</b> after we review your question to see if it's reasonable to humans.<br/>
